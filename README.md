### **Project Name:**
**Obesity Level Prediction using Decision Trees and Random Forest**

---

### **Project Description:**
This project focuses on predicting obesity levels based on individual characteristics such as age, height, weight, dietary habits, and physical activity. The dataset contains information collected from individuals in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, and includes features like family history of overweight, frequency of vegetable consumption, and transportation methods used.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and normalizes numerical features.
- **Model Training**: Implements two machine learning models:
  - **Decision Tree Classifier**
  - **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score**.
- **Reproducibility**: Uses `random_state=42` to ensure reproducible results.

#### **Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive development)

#### **How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Python script to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
4. Check the results in the console or export them to a file.

#### **Dataset:**
The dataset used in this project is the **Obesity Dataset**, which includes 17 features and a target variable (`NObeyesdad`) representing obesity levels. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize features.

#### **Contributing:**
Feel free to contribute to this project by opening issues or submitting pull requests. Suggestions for improving the model or adding new features are welcome!
